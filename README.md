# CraftyBrew

This is a simple example site that will help to demonstrate using Symfony 3, 
Doctrine 2, and some ES6 features in Javascript.

This site is by no means a completely bug-free or working example. However,
over time there are plans to enhance the site and potentially open it up for
outside contributions.

## Installation

To install the site, it is recommended to use [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
to set up the pre-configured environment.

Once installed, run `vagrant up` to create the new virtualbox instance. Then
open your web browser to `https://localhost/`. You will need to accept the
warning that the web browser will display, as the site does not currently use
HTTP.

Thank you! And I hope to hear from you soon with jobs, ideas, or comments.
