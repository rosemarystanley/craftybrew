At Gizmo Brew Works, this meeting of contemporary technology and ancient know-how produces a tempting slate of small-batch beers. Inside tanks that hold the equivalent of 1,000 pints each, brewers prep favorites including the smooth and sweet Black Stiletto Stout and the complex Palisade Wasp India Pale Ale with the same care that has earned many of their past beers medals at the Carolina Championship of Beer. They also save room for seasonals, carefully adding a sweet caramel flavor and spicy Noble hops to their altbier. These beers and more make frequent appearances in the brewery's taproom, gracing pint glasses for impromptu toasts or filling up growlers for at-home sips. Never ones to shy away from curious guests, brewers also open up their facility for Saturday tours, walking groups through the beer-making process during 30-minute explorations.","website":"http:\/\/gizmobrewworks.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/app.expressemailmarketing.com\/Survey.aspx?SFID=161238","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-01 12:35:51","updateDate":"2017-06-21 14:37:38","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"jCUFvI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"615 Oak Ave.","locality":"Spruce Pine","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28705","phone":"828-765-4583","website":"http:\/\/www.drycountybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed\/Thur\/Sun\r\n4-9 pm\r\n\r\nFri\/Sat\r\nNoon-9 pm","latitude":35.9156458,"longitude":-82.0631016,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","breweryId":"Ic6Tku","brewery":{"id":"Ic6Tku","name":"Dry County Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Dry County","description":"Hand tossed pizza and hand crafted beer.

Brian has been an avid home brewer for almost 15 years, while Mike has always enjoyed the culture of breweries. They both felt there was a lack of their style of beer--beer focused on the malted barley and not so focused on the hops.\r\n\r\nRailhouse Brewery currently offers seasonal and year-round beers, including the following: Mastiff Oatmeal Stout, KA-BAR Brown Ale, FCA IPA, Vanilla Porter, Barleywine, and Pale Ale.

As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.  We also offer a large selection of canned and bottled beer, ciders and mead, along with wine and liquor.","website":"http:\/\/www.cloudsbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-06 13:38:27","updateDate":"2016-03-17 14:20:24","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vsVIpN","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"1048 Harper Ave NW","locality":"Lenoir","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28645","phone":"(828) 962-9551","website":"http:\/\/www.eolabeer.com","latitude":35.912819,"longitude":-81.54234,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-30 12:04:41","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","breweryId":"p9zlLd","brewery":{"id":"p9zlLd","name":"Eola Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Eola","description":"Welcome to Eola Beer Company!

Come celebrate with us 110 years of beverage production and bottling onsite! \r\n\r\nHistory: in December 2012, Mastroeli-MacNeil Equity Investments financed the purchase of this 31,690 square foot configuration of two warehouses, situated on 2.08 acres contiguous to Downtown Granite Falls. A panoramic view of the Blue Ridge Mountains runs the rear of the building. The owners financed a painstaking build-out, and are proud of the adaptive reuse of this warehouse\/manufacturing space into a supper club, eatery, and old-style \"watering hole.\" \r\n\r\nThe Brewery: GFB is a 30BBL\/(40BBL) craft beer production facility. We brew onsite and within sight while you indulge your senses in our Southern Gastropub restaurant and attached Tasting Room. Our brewpub features a wraparound 103-foot-long tasting counter, copper\/penny-topped wine bar, and serves as a world-class music venue. Eclectic artifacts dress the spaces for those with an itch for the odd or unique.\r\n\r\nThe owners of Granite Falls Brewing Company invite you to visit our site, indulge in an experience that is In A Glass By Itself, partake of laughter, fellowship and community, lo and behold what we unearthed between the walls and specimens of the original Granite Bottling Works bottles.

He teamed up with Tim O\u2019Neill, a business guru from Portland, Oregon, and the two slowly crafted their vision into reality.  Originally meeting at Travis\u2019 homebrew supply store, the two developed an appreciation for their different brewing approaches, and demand for quality and improvement.  Travis\u2019 father, Tom Caudle, became excited about the prospect and became the company\u2019s CEO and guiding sage.\r\n \r\nAbout our Beer: We take brewing seriously. No Joke. We just happen to find it incredibly fun, and the challenges match the rewards. Brewing is a very involved science and requires careful planning and attention to fine details and metrics. Despite this challenge, we will be constantly updating our tap-list. It will be one of the most heavily rotated craft beer tap-rows in the state. New hops and ingredients are waiting for the perfect recipe, and we intend to find a place for them in your glass.","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetunionbrewing.com\/","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SyVWsn\/upload_3JQA0q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SyVWsn\/upload_3JQA0q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SyVWsn\/upload_3JQA0q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SyVWsn\/upload_3JQA0q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SyVWsn\/upload_3JQA0q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-05-24 23:12:31","updateDate":"2017-05-25 14:11:20","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"UCrDF1","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1249 Wicker Dr Ste A","locality":"Raleigh","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27604-1683","phone":"919-834-0045","website":"http:\/\/bigbossbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 12:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 12:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 2:00am\nThu:  3:00pm - 2:00am\nFri:  2:00pm - 2:00am\nSat:  2:00pm - 2:00am\n\nMON:  4PM \u2013 12PM\r\nTUE:  4PM \u2013 12PM\r\nWED:  4PM \u2013 2AM\r\nTHU:  3PM \u2013 2AM\r\nFRI:  2PM \u2013 2AM\r\nSAT:  2PM \u2013 2AM\r\nSUN:  CLOSED","latitude":35.810418,"longitude":-78.617923,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2016-07-20 12:56:55","breweryId":"pwfPCD","brewery":{"id":"pwfPCD","name":"Big Boss Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Big Boss","description":"Big Boss Brewing Company was started in 2006 and shipped its first beer in the 2nd quarter of 2007 in the triangle area of North Carolina.

When they decided to open a brewery, they wanted it to be a reflection of what they love.\r\n\r\nThe brewery, on Trade Street, has a 15-barrel brewhouse producing traditional styles as well as an ever-changing cast of seasonals and one-offs. The Fish also has seven 60\u201d TVs showing all your favorite sports, a 150\" projector screen for big games, and regular live music, games, and events. Come visit for a tour, or just relax outside on the covered patio.\r\n\r\nLook for Stuart who will be brewing behind the steel frame windows reclaimed from the old Nissen Wagon Works factory, or David managing the taproom painted by local artist Hieronymus.\r\n\r\nFiddlin\u2019 Fish Brewing Company is about community, beer, and paddling your own path down the river.","website":"http:\/\/www.fiddlinfish.com\/","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-22 18:13:05","updateDate":"2018-03-22 19:03:20","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"QKrVH5","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"702 Arendell St.","locality":"Morehead City","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28557","phone":"\u200b(252) 773-0974","latitude":34.7215236,"longitude":-76.7116091,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-24 19:56:02","updateDate":"2017-07-24 19:56:02","breweryId":"5zPMkZ","brewery":{"id":"5zPMkZ","name":"Crystal Coast Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Crystal Coast","description":"Crystal Coast Brewing Company is a family-owned brewery.
