We are located in downtown Weaverville which is just 10 minutes from downtown Asheville.\r\n\r\nWe offer small pours and flights of both the beers that we have bottled as well as experimental small batches available only at the brewery. Chilled bottles are available for enjoying on or off premise as well.\r\n\r\nThe name Zebulon was chosen because it just sounds awesome, and it starts with a Z which is always cool. There is the famous explorer Zebulon Pike, there is the USS Zebulon from Star Trek, and of course the locally born NC governor Zebulon Vance.

In January of 2013 Lenny Boy became the only Certified Organic kombucha producer in the Southeast! In September 2013, we took it a step further and became a licensed microbrewery.  In doing so, we became the only certified organic brewery North Carolina! The new license allowed us to diversify our product line, which now includes kombucha, wild ales, and traditional beers. We currently produce 100 bbl of kombucha every month and have a 7 bbl traditional beer brewing system. Our kombucha can be found from Virginia to Alabama and our beers are currently within North Carolina.
