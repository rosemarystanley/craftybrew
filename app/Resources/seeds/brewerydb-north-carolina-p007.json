Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d. So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/goT5b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:20:55","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"zDo8u8","name":"Raleigh","streetAddress":"505 W.

One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to homebrew. Chris thought Charlotte was missing a small neighborhood brewery where folks could stop in for a pint or take home a growler of super-fresh, unfiltered, American-style ale. They invited a handful of close friends over to pitch a business plan and serve Conor\u2019s beer, and the Birdsong Brewing Co. was born.\r\n\r\nBirdsong started in 2011 with just two full-time employees. Since then, we\u2019ve brewed all kinds of exciting beers. Thanks to the overwhelming response, we\u2019ve since purchased a 17,000-square-foot building in the Belmont neighborhood with a new 30-barrel brewhouse and room for up to 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.\r\n\r\nOur new taproom opened at the corner of N. Davidson St & Belmont Ave, just outside of uptown Charlotte in April 2015. The brewery has become what it is today thanks to hardworking, creative and passionate employees. At Birdsong, #CanDoWillDo is the philosophy behind what we brew, how we think and what we believe.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2017-09-21 13:20:27","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MCuJ2M","name":"Tap Room & Restaurant","streetAddress":"108 W Jefferson Ave","locality":"West Jefferson","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28694","phone":"336-246-5222","website":"http:\/\/www.boondocks-brewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thur 11am-9pm\r\nFri-Sat 11am-Late\r\nSun 11am-9pm","latitude":36.400784,"longitude":-81.492077,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-29 20:44:05","updateDate":"2015-03-25 15:50:41","breweryId":"Pf7pos","brewery":{"id":"Pf7pos","name":"Boondocks Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Boondocks","description":"Our Craft is our Passion\r\n\r\nBoondocks Brewing was founded in 2012 with a mission to provide a fresh, unique and engaging destination for residents as well as visitors to Ashe County.
