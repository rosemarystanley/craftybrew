Like what, you wonder? We're making beer with sweet potatoes, corn grits, summer basil, and malted barley house-smoked over hickory. Other successful \"plow to pint\" experiments to-date include beer brewed with scuppernong grapes, persimmon, paw paw, rhubarb and more. \r\n\r\nUltimately, our vision is to craft a year-round, sustainable, scalable, and distinctly Southern beer brewed 100% with local ingredients. That's the quest. We're a long ways from realizing this vision, but we hope you enjoy the adventure as much as we expect to. Interested?

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.brevard-brewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:03:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:05","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ZYuYcJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1315 West Main Street","locality":"Sylva","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28779","latitude":35.3728539,"longitude":-83.2359759,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 12:13:49","updateDate":"2017-09-05 17:44:22","breweryId":"OZbzBF","brewery":{"id":"OZbzBF","name":"The Sneak E Squirrel","nameShortDisplay":"The Sneak E Squirrel","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OZbzBF\/upload_ZOjQ3t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OZbzBF\/upload_ZOjQ3t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OZbzBF\/upload_ZOjQ3t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OZbzBF\/upload_ZOjQ3t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OZbzBF\/upload_ZOjQ3t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 12:13:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:00:43","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"NDPKIS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"116-E South Kerr Avenue","locality":"Wilmington","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28403","phone":"(910) 274-2258","latitude":34.2387648,"longitude":-77.8891697,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","yearClosed":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:16:46","updateDate":"2015-10-14 15:07:39","breweryId":"H7XluE","brewery":{"id":"H7XluE","name":"Good Vibes Brew","nameShortDisplay":"Good Vibes Brew","description":"Good Vibes Brew is a local micro brewery locally owned and operated in Carolina Beach, North Carolina.","website":"http:\/\/www.goodvibesbrew.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H7XluE\/upload_VrwCr6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H7XluE\/upload_VrwCr6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H7XluE\/upload_VrwCr6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H7XluE\/upload_VrwCr6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H7XluE\/upload_VrwCr6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:12:19","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:06","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"BsdMlk","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"High Point","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27260","website":"http:\/\/twelvetribesbrewing.com\/","latitude":35.9623181,"longitude":-79.9752212,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 12:19:12","updateDate":"2017-08-23 03:23:36","breweryId":"dD3bU7","brewery":{"id":"dD3bU7","name":"XII Tribes Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"XII Tribes","description":"Dedicated to quality craft beer, & creating a culture of integrity for the everyday go-getter.
