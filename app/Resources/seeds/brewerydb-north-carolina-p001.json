Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.","website":"http:\/\/skullcoastales.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:13:41","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"L50oJn","name":"High Point","streetAddress":"914 Mall Loop Rd","locality":"High Point","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27262","phone":"(336) 882-4677","hoursOfOperation":"Open 11am Daily","latitude":35.988478,"longitude":-80.00451,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-10 19:30:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","breweryId":"XOcBJQ","brewery":{"id":"XOcBJQ","name":"Liberty Steakhouse and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Liberty Steakhouse","description":"Liberty means many things to many different people.

Manorhouses and the beer they produced were unique to families and the communities of which they were a part. We will fulfill all those same criteria. \r\n\r\nManor House Brewing represents an alternative to conventional beer, we are prideful in our local roots and want to inspire pride in our local community. Our beer is an output of a thoughtful creative process and we view what we do as art, not commodity. We experiment with new things, but try to predict the outcome in advance. Every so often, we accidentally stumble upon greatness.\r\n\r\nWhy do we want to brew beer? To satisfy a longing for the simple pleasures and a simpler time. Happiness, joy, and relaxation is our goal.\r\n\r\nHow are we different from every other craft brewer? The very same thing that makes us the same. We are creative, innovative and different. We do not feel compelled to brew to style as we may create our own, but when we do brew to style, we do so with passion.","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:21:21","isMassOwned":"N","brandClassification":"craft"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"z3YEc1","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6901 Konica Drive","locality":"Whitsett","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27377","phone":"888-Red-Oaks","website":"http:\/\/www.redoakbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Brewery Tours are every Friday at 3:00 pm (21 and up only).

In addition to brewing according to the Law of Purity, we decided not to filter or pasteurize our Bavarian Lagers to ensure the vitamins remain whole for that rich, mellow taste. Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24\/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40\/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.  By the summer of 2007 Red Oak was ready to open the nation's most modern computerized brewing facility...consistently producing the Freshest, Purest, Bavarian Lagers in America.","website":"http:\/\/www.redoakbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hNPjUO\/upload_Renjg8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hNPjUO\/upload_Renjg8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hNPjUO\/upload_Renjg8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hNPjUO\/upload_Renjg8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hNPjUO\/upload_Renjg8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
